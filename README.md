## Coding
I have chosen StatefulWidget to update the ImageView with the gif url, As the updated gif has the same
url so i have added random number as the query parameter to observe the changes so that the
ImageView will update using 'setState()'

## Design
Added a 'Generate' button to the bottom of the screen and the rest will be the ImageView, as the imageview
sizes are dynamic


## Test cases
Written test cases on finding the button with 'Generate' text
